generic-slave-puppet-configuration
===========================

Provides a puppet manifest with basic modules for a generic jenkins slave.

Following the steps below all packages, dependencies and modules required (including this repository) are downloaded and applied using _puppet apply_.

Make sure that an appropriate SSL certificate is present to clone the required repositories from GitHub. This can be achieved by installing one manually or by using ssh [agent forwarding](https://help.github.com/articles/using-ssh-agent-forwarding). For the latter you might need to make your key available via `ssh-add -K` first.

## Requirements

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS minimal install

## Production Setup

```bash
# ensure that all package information are up-to-date
sudo apt-get update

# install git, puppet, ruby-dev and make if not present
sudo apt-get -y install git-core puppet ruby-dev make

# install librarian-puppet gem (you might need to reopen your terminal afterwards)
sudo gem install librarian-puppet --version 1.3.0

# checkout puppet provisioning repository and apply
git clone git@github.com:hoccer/generic-slave-puppet-configuration.git
cd generic-slave-puppet-configuration

# install puppet modules
librarian-puppet install --verbose

# apply puppet configuration
sudo -E puppet apply init.pp --no-report --modulepath modules --verbose
```

## Development Setup

The provisioning can be tested on a local VM using Vagrant as follows:

```bash
# create VM
vagrant up

# log into VM
vagrant ssh

# go to shared folder on the VM
cd /vagrant

# install puppet modules
librarian-puppet install --verbose

# apply puppet configuration
sudo -E puppet apply init.pp --no-report --modulepath modules --verbose
```

## Extend Java Security

To run all cryptography tests it might be necessary to extend the java security policy. This is described [here](https://github.com/hoccer/hoccer-talk-spike/wiki/Extend-Java-Security).
